# ðŸ§¬ Preliminary Finding: SVs enriched in segmental duplications

## 1. Research Question
> Are structural variants preferentially located in duplicated regions?

## 2. Key References
| No. | Citation | Species | Method | Main Finding | Relevance |
|-----|-----------|----------|----------|----------------|-------------|
| 1 | Eichler et al., *Science*, 2019 | Human | Long-read WGS | SV hotspots overlap with segmental duplications | Mirrors our finding |
| 2 | Li et al., *Nat Commun*, 2020 | Mouse | Nanopore | SVs enriched near SDs | Supports same mechanism |

## 3. Summary of Evidence
- SDs are known to be mutationally unstable regions.  
- Replication slippage and NAHR are key mechanisms.

## 4. Integration with Our Data
| Aspect | Literature Insight | Our Data | Next Step |
|--------|--------------------|-----------|-------------|
| Mechanism | NAHR, replication slippage | Similar pattern | Validate via sequence motifs |

## 5. Notes
- Human SDs differ in size distribution from cattle.
- Our current assembly may miss smaller SDs.
